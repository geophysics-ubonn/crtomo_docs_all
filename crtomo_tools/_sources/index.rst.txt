Welcome to crtomo tools's documentation!
========================================

This document describes the scripts and libraries of the crtomo_tools package.
These tools are written in the Python programming language and provide command
line tools for common tasks such as generating triangular finite-element meshes
for CRMod/CRTomo, or modifying existing grids.

Also included is the Python module *crtomo*, which aims at providing an
interface to all functions of CRMod and CRTomo. Thus, CRMod/CRTomo can be fully
controlled using Python. This also includes retreiving any data output produced
by either of the programs.

.. note::

    The Python abstraction is not yet finished, and is mostly worked on when
    the need arises.
