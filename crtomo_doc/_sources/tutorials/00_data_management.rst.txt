Data Management
---------------

This section presents various aspects of preparation and data management
techniques that should be followed during measurements.


.. note::

    In the future this section should be moved somewhere outside of the
    crtomo_doc manual, but for now this seems like a good place.

        How can we use the data? If data is measured in the Department of
        Geophysics, leave this field blank. Otherwise note the owner and any known
        usage rights.

Preparing the measurements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Make a rough plan of the analysis procedures

  * Which environment variables do you need to measure/capture?
  * How do your expected final results look like? Which plots comprise the
    final results?


During the measurements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Create sketches of the field site/laboratory setup containing
  electrodes, electrode numbers, (if possible: topography), and all other
  important objects/features (note also possible sources of error, e.g. cars or
  other metallic stuff)

After the measurements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Sort (and backup) data files.
* Create ``Readme.txt`` files containing all important information (and/or
  references to additional documents).
* Create text files containing electrode positions (x, z), z direction points
  upwards (topography).
* Make a list of the data sets you want to process, i.e. which data
  sets to process individually and which to process together (e.g.
  normal-reciprocals).
* Create the FE-grids for the subsequent analysis. Sometimes it is advisable to
  create a fine and a coarse grid. Initial data processing can be done using
  the coarse grid to save time.
* Inspect the data and set filters.
* Run preliminary inversions.
* Make sure that you don't have too large normal-reciprocal differences (not
  only in absolute, but also in relative values).
* Regarding merged data sets: It is advisable to only use them if only
  normal-reciprocal pairs are used. Otherwise its possible that spectra get
  distored when only parts of the spectra are merged (i.e. averaged).
